                    I came from Brasil to Winnipeg to attend to the Business Information Technology course at Red River College.
                    I have graduated from a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, while I was running my own business with my brother in my home country.
                    We've ran the business for about 10 years, then I entered the police and started working as a Crime Scene Investigator for 4 years, before coming to Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have great interest and some experience in working with web development, and have worked on my skills in the field,
                    learning new tools and technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My experience working at the Police improved my creative thinking, attention to details, accepting my responsibilities
                    and keeping always learning new skills. I use this knowledge daily while facing new challenges. Running my own business
                    has also gave my solid skills in working on teams, project management and execution, dealing and negotiating with clients.
                </p>
